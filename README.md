## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why do I need to connect to Spotify?
The extension uses Spotify's extensive music database to fetch high-quality album artwork. Your Spotify account is only used for API access - no personal data is stored.

### Does this work with all videos?
The extension specifically targets music content. It won't affect non-music videos like vlogs, tutorials, or podcasts.

### The wrong album cover is showing
Some factors can affect accuracy:
- Remix versions may show original album art
- Live performances might not have specific covers
- Title formatting (feat., vs., &) can impact matching

**To report an issue:**
1. Note the exact video title and URL
2. Take a screenshot if possible
3. [Open an issue](https://github.com/1102Aryan/VideoToAlbumCover/issues) with details

### Can I use this without Spotify Premium?
Yes! A free Spotify account works perfectly. Premium is not required.

### Does this affect video quality or performance?
No, the video continues playing normally in the background. Only the visual element is replaced.
